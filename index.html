<pre>
  1
  00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,460
   Let's first talk about CERN and the large Hadron Collider.
  
  2
  00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,000
   People have heard about that or most people have.
  
  3
  00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,339
   They've seen pictures of it and all kinds of speculation and theories.
  
  4
  00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:35,560
   Give us a quick definition, first just from a purely scientific point of view, what the
  
  5
  00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,060
   collider is, what its purpose is.
  
  6
  00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,879
   The scientific purpose is to take particles and accelerate them towards reaching the
  
  7
  00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,460
   threshold with the speed of light.
  
  8
  00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,939
   To then collide them, fracturing them into smaller particles, for the purpose of trying
  
  9
  00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:56,100
   to determine the basis for creation.
  
  10
  00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,200
   To find the building blocks of the universe in all known life.
  
  11
  00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,740
   That's what science will tell you in the public arena.
  
  12
  00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:11,500
   Where my research has led me is into the hidden agenda at CERN.
  
  13
  00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,060
   That's really been my calling.
  
  14
  00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,140
   From the Lord is to really reveal the truth behind the public agendas at CERN, which is
  
  15
  00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,420
   a nuclear research facility utilizing a particle collider.
  
  16
  00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:33,900
   Now it's in a giant somewhat circular shape that covers how many miles is that hole collider.
  
  17
  00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,019
   As you travel along it, you cover 27 miles.
  
  18
  00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,019
   27 miles.
  
  19
  00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:44,140
   Well geographically on the map, it's located on the border between Switzerland and France.
  
  20
  00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,379
   It's near Geneva.
  
  21
  00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,500
   It's a sovereign state unto itself.
  
  22
  00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,579
   What's a sovereign state unto itself?
  
  23
  00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,820
   That would be a self-governing body.
  
  24
  00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,420
   So how much like the Vatican?
  
  25
  00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,579
   I never heard this before.
  
  26
  00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,420
   The collider is in its own state like the Vatican.
  
  27
  00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,980
   And similar to Washington DC, the District of Columbia.
  
  28
  00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,780
   So it's based on, I guess, their theory or research or whatever that.
  
  29
  00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,340
   If they crack open atomic sub-atomic particles, just crack them open.
  
  30
  00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,099
   They are saying, at least publicly, that they can find the secrets to the origins of
  
  31
  00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,180
   the universe, et cetera, et cetera.
  
  32
  00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,260
   But you say that this is not like speculation.
  
  33
  00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,260
   From your research, you're saying that behind the scenes, they have a hidden agenda that
  
  34
  00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,540
   they're not admitting to the public.
  
  35
  00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
   That's correct.
  
  36
  00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,340
   Tell us what your research leads you to believe their hidden agenda is.
  
  37
  00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,100
   Well, it's interesting because today it is no longer hidden.
  
  38
  00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,700
   They are not hiding their goals.
  
  39
  00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,339
   In fact, they're pronounced in a pronounced fashion announcing it.
  
  40
  00:02:55,339 --> 00:03:02,219
   Last year, the previous director of the collider facility announced that their goal openly
  
  41
  00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,899
   is to open a dimensional gateway to another dimension.
  
  42
  00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:08,019
   You might call it a portal.
  
  43
  00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:13,939
   And when you begin to put that in the context of our everyday reality, that seems absurd.
  
  44
  00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:20,219
   And he also made the statement that we don't know what we will find or what may come
  
  45
  00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,460
   through from the other side, but we're willing to risk it.
  
  46
  00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,460
   This is mind-blowing.
  
  47
  00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,900
   So we're not talking even really about your research.
  
  48
  00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,819
   We're not talking about speculation.
  
  49
  00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,460
   So Anthony, this is, again, this is not a conspiracy theory.
  
  50
  00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:42,460
   This is the published statement of the former head of CERN.
  
  51
  00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,379
   And he's talking about, did he use the word entity?
  
  52
  00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,659
   What word did he use?
  
  53
  00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,060
   No, he didn't assign a title to what might come through.
  
  54
  00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,539
   He just didn't know what would come through.
  
  55
  00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,300
   He didn't know what would come through.
  
  56
  00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,859
   So that's kind of ominous.
  
  57
  00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:58,859
   It is.
  
  58
  00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,180
   We're cracking open a hole in this dimension.
  
  59
  00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,180
   Am I correct?
  
  60
  00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,180
   Yep.
  
  61
  00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,579
   And we don't know what would come through.
  
  62
  00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:12,419
   From your research, tell us what you think he was implying and what has your research
  
  63
  00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,659
   revealed about what's really going on.
  
  64
  00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,779
   And the research has revealed that there are already in communication with the other side,
  
  65
  00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,180
   with entities on the other side.
  
  66
  00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
   Very sought.
  
  67
  00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,019
   This is mind-blowing.
  
  68
  00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:33,540
   The research has shown that they're already in communication with what on the other side?
  
  69
  00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,139
   Well, in my frame of reference, and I think we share this, these should be demonic entities.
  
  70
  00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:45,620
   And have they assigned a word to the communication to these beings or whatever in another dimension?
  
  71
  00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,620
   No, other than to say that these perhaps are our benevolent ancestors from the stars.
  
  72
  00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,780
   Who are coming to solve all of our problems and remove all of our ills from our society?
  
  73
  00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:06,500
   This is so pal, this is what you're talking about is a paradigm shift that's just about
  
  74
  00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,660
   ready to detonate on planet Earth.
  
  75
  00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
   That's correct.
  
  76
  00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,579
   This is going to shake up the faith of many Christians and people of belief and non-belief
  
  77
  00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,500
   it's going to shake their very view of reality to the core.
  
  78
  00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,259
   Just like when Darwin's theory of evolution was promoted, it just tore up people's view
  
  79
  00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,259
   of reality.
  
  80
  00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,779
   You know, God didn't create us.
  
  81
  00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,779
   We're evolved animals.
  
  82
  00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:36,299
   I mean, that just ripped up the fabric of the entire sociological spiritual structure of
  
  83
  00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,299
   the planet.
  
  84
  00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:38,299
   The paradigm shift.
  
  85
  00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,899
   Right, a paradigm shift.
  
  86
  00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,379
   And so we're right.
  
  87
  00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,379
   Why?
  
  88
  00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,620
   Has the paradigm shift begun?
  
  89
  00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,459
   Or where are we in terms of that?
  
  90
  00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,459
   In the popular culture, it has begun because we're seeing the predictive programming in
  
  91
  00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,459
   the mass media.
  
  92
  00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,500
   In the films and commercials.
  
  93
  00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,060
   Think of it in terms of brainwashing.
  
  94
  00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,459
   We are predicting the behavior of humans using human behavior modeling in the computer,
  
  95
  00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,779
   using a program.
  
  96
  00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,939
   That if we put out this stimuli, we will achieve this type of response in human beings,
  
  97
  00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:13,099
   no matter the culture, no matter where they live.
  
  98
  00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,540
   And so this is going to what we're going to talk about in a moment is the adiabatic quantum
  
  99
  00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,580
   computer, which is artificially intelligent.
  
  100
  00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,540
   Predictive programming, in essence, is saying if we create this program, the television
  
  101
  00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,780
   program, a movie, and we put in images that are violent, we put in images about portals,
  
  102
  00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,300
   we talk about aliens being benevolent, then it becomes sort of in their mind a self-fulfilling
  
  103
  00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:45,180
   prophecy that people will believe the lie, become victims of that grand deception of predictive
  
  104
  00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,740
   programming, and therefore will follow lockstep whatever it is there being fed so that you
  
  105
  00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,980
   are able to modify their behavior and make them become part of the new world order and
  
  106
  00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
   follow the B system.
  
  107
  00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,900
   This science of predictive programming that you were talking about, and it is a science,
  
  108
  00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:10,099
   I mean this goes back before HG Wells, the great science fiction author and Aldous Huxley,
  
  109
  00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:17,500
   Brave New World, they were employing predictive programming, and the Star Trek series developed
  
  110
  00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,899
   by Jean Roddenberry as you know was for the purpose of predictive programming to promote
  
  111
  00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,620
   a UN global government.
  
  112
  00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:36,100
   And now as you just said, all these science fiction superhero, technological singularity,
  
  113
  00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,379
   movies, and trans-humanist, trans-formist, everything from Captain America, it is just
  
  114
  00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,699
   embedded with this in the culture.
  
  115
  00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,699
   Exactly.
  
  116
  00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:52,300
   And so young people are, they're conversant in what you're saying, but more importantly,
  
  117
  00:07:52,300 --> 00:08:00,300
   what you're saying, these movies like Divergent and the Hunger Games, you know, those movies
  
  118
  00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,100
   are embedded with subconscious subliminal messages.
  
  119
  00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,860
   They're not designed to be in my opinion, just entertainment.
  
  120
  00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,139
   They're employing predictive programming.
  
  121
  00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:20,060
   And let's go to the recent television show Lucifer, how they portray Satan as a debonair
  
  122
  00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,819
   ladies man, British accent.
  
  123
  00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:23,819
   Wow.
  
  124
  00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,819
   You know, they're making Lucifer look good.
  
  125
  00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,819
   Right.
  
  126
  00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,819
   Making Lucifer look good.
  
  127
  00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,500
   So talk about programming people into believing a lie.
  
  128
  00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
   Right.
  
  129
  00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
   It's right in our face.
  
  130
  00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,100
   It's right in our face.
  
  131
  00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
   Yep.
  
  132
  00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,940
   So people being programmed, and we know that the result of this is already measurable.
  
  133
  00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,259
   I was doing research the other day, and the fastest growing religion in America is
  
  134
  00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,939
   Wicca, which, as you know, is paganism and witchcraft.
  
  135
  00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,819
   And number two is Islam.
  
  136
  00:08:54,819 --> 00:09:05,100
   So now this collider and these beings that they're in communication with.
  
  137
  00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,139
   So we're talking about the premier scientists on planet Earth right now who are actively
  
  138
  00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:21,899
   engaged, according to their own words, communicating with something, something with a personality
  
  139
  00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,179
   in their own words in a, in a, from another dimension.
  
  140
  00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,779
   And that's the purpose of the collider.
  
  141
  00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,139
   I mean, people need to understand this is not science fiction.
  
  142
  00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,139
   This is fact.
  
  143
  00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:35,139
   That's correct.
  
  144
  00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:41,740
   What I write about in my novels, right, I place a storyline that is embedded with science
  
  145
  00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
   fact.
  
  146
  00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,740
   Everything that I present publicly in the books, public speaking, is all drawn from their own
  
  147
  00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,340
   scientific journals and white papers.
  
  148
  00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,980
   And then I'm able to see what they're doing.
  
  149
  00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,659
   Not just extrapolate, but see in the real time what it is they're doing.
  
  150
  00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:00,860
   Not a future agenda, but what they're doing right now today.
  
  151
  00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,899
   The imminency of what they intend to do, which is opening this gateway, and understand
  
  152
  00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:13,699
   that the world of science in terms of particle physics also overlaps into DNA and to biology.
  
  153
  00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:14,699
   Yes.
  
  154
  00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:17,860
   There's a multifaceted, multi-level agenda at play.
  
  155
  00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,100
   Not just was CERN, but it's proof of concept feeder labs around the world that feed into
  
  156
  00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
   CERN.
  
  157
  00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,699
   So we're talking about changing humans, changing the planet.
  
  158
  00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:34,500
   We're talking about not only bringing in information through a portal, but we're also talking
  
  159
  00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,740
   about definitively changing our way of life.
  
  160
  00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,899
   This is a threat to our existence, to the creation of mankind.
  
  161
  00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,299
   A threat to our existence, a threat to the creation of mankind.
  
  162
  00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,659
   So they're communicating with some kind of entity.
  
  163
  00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,860
   You and I would believe that these entities are full on angels.
  
  164
  00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
   Right.
  
  165
  00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,419
   And then your research is shown.
  
  166
  00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:01,220
   This is being distributed to feeder labs all over planet earth and who knows what other
  
  167
  00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:11,500
   kind of research institutes and technology because they have an end game of radically restructuring
  
  168
  00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,060
   man, woman, the entire planet.
  
  169
  00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:22,300
   This is almost impossible question, but in a brief summary, give our viewers an idea
  
  170
  00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,660
   of what their radical end game is.
  
  171
  00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,540
   Well my answer is radical.
  
  172
  00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,899
   Ultimately it is to kill God in the hubris of Satan of Lucifer.
  
  173
  00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:38,860
   He believes that he actually has the ability to kill our gods angels and kill God.
  
  174
  00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,099
   He believes he can create a new heaven on earth that he can create a new race of beings.
  
  175
  00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:48,779
   He hates everything that God has created including us.
  
  176
  00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:54,259
   And he is the mirror image of everything that God has created that is all that is good.
  
  177
  00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,500
   And so if you 180 that, if you flip that over, if you make
  
  178
  00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,899
   it a mirror, think of everything that is good in the world that God has created, go to the
  
  179
  00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,620
   opposite side and that's what Satan's goal is to present his form of life and his form
  
  180
  00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,139
   of heaven here on earth using technology.
  
  181
  00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,179
   Now I need to make it clear that I don't hold any ill will against the scientists, the
  
  182
  00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,580
   researchers, engineers.
  
  183
  00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,019
   They are deceived into believing one of the original lies that ye shall be as gods that
  
  184
  00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,580
   you will have immortality.
  
  185
  00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
   That's the carrot.
  
  186
  00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:35,660
   So the scientists and the technology people, many of them are under the spiritual delusion
  
  187
  00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:43,379
   or spiritual deception that they are evolving man into a superhuman or a god man.
  
  188
  00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,379
   Exactly.
  
  189
  00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,379
   Exactly.
  
  190
  00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:52,180
   So if they are thinking in terms of what we are doing is for the betterment of mankind,
  
  191
  00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:58,299
   that's the compartmental aspect of their research, compartmentalization that they work in.
  
  192
  00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:03,179
   Outside they are cut off from the outside of who's promoting the machine, who's funding
  
  193
  00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,099
   it to what end.
  
  194
  00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:10,000
   So if you were to ask one of those researchers and say, are you guys trying to open a portal
  
  195
  00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,419
   on the lead in demons or are you trying to terraform a planet for a new race of beings,
  
  196
  00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,659
   what have you been smoking?
  
  197
  00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,659
   Right.
  
  198
  00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:24,459
   Because they are cut off, we have the opportunity being removed from that compartment to see
  
  199
  00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:28,579
   it from a different perspective, from a bigger perspective.
  
  200
  00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,419
   And that's given to us through the Holy Spirit, through that discernment.
  
  201
  00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:35,100
   We are able to see what is hidden.
  
  202
  00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,179
   We do our research, we do our due diligence, but then we clearly see what is really going
  
  203
  00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:41,179
   on.
  
  204
  00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:45,139
   One of the examples going back to your initial question, the Statue of Shiva, the God
  
  205
  00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,139
   of Destruction.
  
  206
  00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:52,819
   Right there, outside the headquarters at CERN, they produced a video last year from CERN
  
  207
  00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:56,860
   called Cemetery, complete satanic rituals.
  
  208
  00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,139
   Recently just a few days ago, there was the opening of the Goddard tunnel in Switzerland
  
  209
  00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,980
   near CERN, purely demonic rituals.
  
  210
  00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,580
   I just saw that.
  
  211
  00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
   Go ahead CERN.
  
  212
  00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
   It was terrifying.
  
  213
  00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,580
   Yeah, absolutely.
  
  214
  00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,419
   Did that video of the demonic rituals opening the tunnel?
  
  215
  00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,659
   And I only had a brief opportunity to look at it, I saw what was going on.
  
  216
  00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:22,539
   It was an openly demonic, it was devoted to the worship of Satan in my face.
  
  217
  00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:28,579
   But I knew that it was the Goddard tunnel, but I didn't realize it was connected to the
  
  218
  00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:29,899
   whole CERN thing.
  
  219
  00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,659
   Well, physically it's not connected.
  
  220
  00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:32,659
   Right.
  
  221
  00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:33,659
   You want to make that clear.
  
  222
  00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:37,980
   But in the sense of the spiritual world and the communication, I see the ritual, they
  
  223
  00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,980
   are connected.
  
  224
  00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,980
   Right.
  
  225
  00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,379
   In that ceremony, that demonstration, they showed the opening of the portal that CERN
  
  226
  00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,060
   will achieve.
  
  227
  00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,899
   And the tunnel itself represents in physics, quantum tunneling, which is a communication,
  
  228
  00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:58,379
   utilizing an artificially intelligent computer, an adiabatic quantum computer, which runs
  
  229
  00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:04,940
   its computations through another dimension, retrieves that information and other dimension,
  
  230
  00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,060
   achieving a solution that we can use in our world.
  
  231
  00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,299
   Now that is real, that's not fantasy that comes right from the manufacturer.
  
  232
  00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:18,179
   This is the machine that is employed now, just recently, now at CERN, and will be responsible
  
  233
  00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,699
   for the initiation of the opening of the portal and the stability, the holding open of the
  
  234
  00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:30,779
   portal for the receiving of, and I'll give this definitively, it's digitized DNA, demonic
  
  235
  00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:37,859
   DNA, in a digitized form, ones and zeros coming through this portal, received here, reassembled
  
  236
  00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,139
   if you will, and then presented to a hybrid body.
  
  237
  00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:49,980
   Because as you said, Lucifer desires to be God as the Bible says, and Lucifer desires
  
  238
  00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,019
   to create his own race and his own image.
  
  239
  00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,019
   Exactly.
  
  240
  00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:59,580
   And I think you would agree, this is very hard for many Christians to grasp.
  
  241
  00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,700
   It's a truth that it's hard for Christians to really own.
  
  242
  00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,860
   And that is, the world is exactly as the Bible says that it is.
  
  243
  00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:16,700
   And there's an invisible world, Lucifer at the top, his hierarchy of demons, he compartmentalizes
  
  244
  00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,259
   information on a need to know basis.
  
  245
  00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:28,580
   And at the very top, there are men and women who are open Luciferians.
  
  246
  00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,420
   They have committed themselves, they participate in rituals to the worship of Satan.
  
  247
  00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:39,539
   Because as you said, they believe that they're going to conquer Christ, and Satan is the true
  
  248
  00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,419
   or Lucifer is the true God.
  
  249
  00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,419
   That's right.
  
  250
  00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:49,419
   Now, you said that, and I said that, and the Bible says that, but for some reason, there's
  
  251
  00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:53,219
   almost a veil in the minds of many Christians.
  
  252
  00:16:53,219 --> 00:17:00,259
   And I pray, as we interview you, that the Holy Spirit would just break that veil of deception
  
  253
  00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:07,420
   and that God's people could really see reality as it really is, instead of living in this
  
  254
  00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:13,700
   kind of fog state, which is based on their unbelief of God's work.
  
  255
  00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,259
   Well, let's use the collider for our purposes.
  
  256
  00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,259
   Okay.
  
  257
  00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:19,500
   Let's call that evidence.
  
  258
  00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,900
   It's physical, it's tangible, it's right there in our face.
  
  259
  00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:30,180
   If we accept this symbology they have presented, which is demonic and origin, their statues,
  
  260
  00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,500
   their videos, and we take that at face value as definitive evidence to the hidden agenda.
  
  261
  00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,060
   We can say there's the machine, the most powerful machine, the largest machine ever created
  
  262
  00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,539
   in recorded history of mankind.
  
  263
  00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,380
   And that is definitive proof that we have a problem.
  
  264
  00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,900
   This is an extension level event, this opening of the portal.
  
  265
  00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,700
   If we look at the wars, they say extension, or extension, I'm sorry.
  
  266
  00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
   Okay.
  
  267
  00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,860
   If we look at the wars that are going on right now, imagine if that portal was open, the
  
  268
  00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,140
   key to the bottomless pit is the large-ager-on collider.
  
  269
  00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,779
   If they were to turn that key and open that doorway and we were flooded, the wars would
  
  270
  00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:20,620
   seem insignificant and all the other ills of the planet compared to the opening of this
  
  271
  00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,819
   portal.
  
  272
  00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:27,299
   This is why it is imperative because it's right now today and it's in our face and it's
  
  273
  00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,019
   tangible proof.
  
  274
  00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:31,259
   That breaks down our own veil.
  
  275
  00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,259
   Okay.
  
  276
  00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:42,940
   So, Anthony is telling you in a methodical, rational, logical way that we have evidence,
  
  277
  00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,819
   the visual pictures, the videotapes, the published statements of the heads, some of the heads of
  
  278
  00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:57,019
   CERN, and they are saying in their videos and the visuals and the evidence that you're
  
  279
  00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:02,379
   talking about, if you showed it in the courtroom, it would be acceptable evidence of openly
  
  280
  00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:10,460
   demonic worship of Satan and open admission of many of the agendas that you talked about.
  
  281
  00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,379
   Now, since this is true and it is true because you have evidence to back up what you're
  
  282
  00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:16,379
   saying.
  
  283
  00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:17,379
   Absolutely.
  
  284
  00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:20,539
   And there's also no conflict between what you're saying and the Bible.
  
  285
  00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,500
   In fact, the Bible would support what you're saying.
  
  286
  00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
   Revelation 9.
  
  287
  00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:34,660
   And when the fruit of their hidden agendas, when these beings start moving through the
  
  288
  00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:44,380
   portal and entering into the earth, I don't think most Christians are ready for the physical
  
  289
  00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:53,660
   manifestation and the supernatural changes that occur in what we call our present reality.
  
  290
  00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,740
   Our present reality is about ready to be violently shaken and reshaped.
  
  291
  00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,779
   They are all ready in communication with something that has a personality and has ability
  
  292
  00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,019
   to communicate.
  
  293
  00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:16,540
   And the information that they're receiving must be very high level information because
  
  294
  00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:24,059
   they're feeding it to laboratories and technologies all across the planet.
  
  295
  00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:31,899
   And what you said, which is so sobering, that video on the internet that captured the,
  
  296
  00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:38,940
   it was an open, satanic worship ceremony, I guess in the Goddard tunnel.
  
  297
  00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,940
   And I saw it and I was like, my mouth hung open because it was so in your face, Luciferian
  
  298
  00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,940
   and satanic.
  
  299
  00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,740
   And I would say we've probably not seen something that bold in the mainstream media.
  
  300
  00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
   No, we haven't.
  
  301
  00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
   In our lifetime.
  
  302
  00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
   No, no.
  
  303
  00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:01,820
   And you know, there's been an escalation and it keeps getting faster and more bold and
  
  304
  00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,380
   more prominent.
  
  305
  00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:10,660
   The Illuminati symbols at the super bowls and these giant musical performances and stadiums
  
  306
  00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:19,500
   by music superstars and the Olympics, there are in your face occult messages and satanic
  
  307
  00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:28,580
   messages and symbols, which tells you there's a very powerful Luciferian elite in this world,
  
  308
  00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,740
   very active and they're not hiding anymore.
  
  309
  00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
   No, they're not.
  
  310
  00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,380
   They've come out because they've progressed in their timeline to the point where they
  
  311
  00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,580
   feel invulnerable and no longer have to hold back.
  
  312
  00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,140
   In fact, they want to be more bold about it so that they can gather themselves more converts
  
  313
  00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,940
   to their way.
  
  314
  00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
   That would make sense.
  
  315
  00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:58,300
   That would make sense because here in the US we have this rise in the satanic churches
  
  316
  00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
   exactly.
  
  317
  00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:05,020
   Just openly recruiting, evangelizing, which wouldn't have occurred even five or six years
  
  318
  00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,020
   ago.
  
  319
  00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:13,700
   Now, we're talking about how the information distributed to the scientists and others is
  
  320
  00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,259
   compartmentalized.
  
  321
  00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:19,579
   So, you talk to many of these scientists and I've talked to some of these scientists and
  
  322
  00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,579
   they have no clue as to what you're talking about.
  
  323
  00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:25,779
   And it was obvious to me talking to some of them is that they only have compartmentalized
  
  324
  00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,299
   information.
  
  325
  00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:34,099
   Now, you and I would agree that it's kind of Lucifer's organizational structure is
  
  326
  00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:39,779
   pure, pure medical, with Lucifer on top and then it's on a need to know basis, kind
  
  327
  00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:46,339
   of like a corporation where Lucifer is the CEO, the founder, the chairman of the board.
  
  328
  00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:56,579
   So at the highest level and we know this from reading the documents behind the founding
  
  329
  00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,859
   of the United Nations and so many other organizations.
  
  330
  00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:08,979
   These people were disciples of Madame Bovatsky who openly promoted the worship of Satan.
  
  331
  00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:17,500
   So who would you say is there an organization or is it a group of secret individuals?
  
  332
  00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:24,299
   Who would you say is running this thing driving it on a human level and who is ultimately
  
  333
  00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:29,859
   I know they're using lower level sources to find who's financing this.
  
  334
  00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,299
   Right out of the Vatican.
  
  335
  00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,299
   Right out of the Vatican.
  
  336
  00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,299
   That explain.
  
  337
  00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:38,539
   We can put a figure head to that we can call it the Pope but he's a figure head much like
  
  338
  00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:41,500
   any president or dictator.
  
  339
  00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,859
   But he is the figure head for the structure.
  
  340
  00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:50,019
   The Vatican finances and creates the governmental controls for the entire world.
  
  341
  00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:52,779
   It doesn't matter the culture or the government.
  
  342
  00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,379
   Everybody in lockstep takes their orders from the Vatican.
  
  343
  00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:59,379
   If you were to look at our legal systems.
  
  344
  00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,620
   No matter the country they all derive from the legal system that is put forth by the
  
  345
  00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,820
   Vatican.
  
  346
  00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,020
   Now they have their minions that are sprinkled out and infiltrated into many organizations
  
  347
  00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,140
   like the Illuminati but the short answer is the Vatican.
  
  348
  00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,540
   They worship Saturn, the black sun.
  
  349
  00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:26,700
   If you look at and look for images of Saturn in the clothing, in the adornments, in the
  
  350
  00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,060
   temples.
  
  351
  00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,859
   You will see representations of Saturn everywhere.
  
  352
  00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:38,740
   This is the satanic worship of their false son, their false God, Saturn.
  
  353
  00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,059
   That is where they derive their energy from.
  
  354
  00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,299
   From that worship of their false God, Saturn.
  
  355
  00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:45,019
   Now that sounds absurd.
  
  356
  00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:49,179
   Most people would never put Saturn in the Vatican together.
  
  357
  00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,299
   But it's easy enough to see.
  
  358
  00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,339
   It isn't that occulted.
  
  359
  00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:59,659
   And therefore, who's running, who's pushing the agenda comes right out of the Vatican.
  
  360
  00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:10,740
   But at the same time, outside of the organizational structure and hierarchy of the Vatican, there
  
  361
  00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:17,779
   are many Catholics like the late Malachi, Martin and others, another guy who they say committed
  
  362
  00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:24,700
   suicide by hanging himself, but that was very doubtful.
  
  363
  00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:36,819
   Malachi, Martin, a Catholic, and I believe he was a Jesuit, warned as a Catholic apologist,
  
  364
  00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:41,779
   he warned of the incense of Satan penetrating the Vatican.
  
  365
  00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,940
   And what he was saying, as you know, is that he was alluding.
  
  366
  00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:54,779
   It was his thesis, Malachi, Martin, that Satanism had penetrated the Vatican.
  
  367
  00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,500
   He reached an epoch.
  
  368
  00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
   Right.
  
  369
  00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,779
   So you're not saying all Catholics are.
  
  370
  00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:01,779
   Certainly not.
  
  371
  00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:02,779
   Right, okay.
  
  372
  00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:09,180
   We're talking about if you will a governmental structure, a political, a theological structure.
  
  373
  00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,779
   We're not attacking people.
  
  374
  00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:16,099
   But we're looking at the structure that was assembled and promulgated by Satan himself
  
  375
  00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:23,259
   and the direct in your face worship of Lucifer by that hierarchy in that structure.
  
  376
  00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:32,500
   Okay, so it's interesting to me because I get emails from everybody.
  
  377
  00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:40,339
   And you have one segment saying it's the Jews who are responsible for all the evils
  
  378
  00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:48,379
   in the world, protocols of the learned elders who are Zion and some say it's the Vatican
  
  379
  00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:50,459
   and there's this world of confusion.
  
  380
  00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:57,339
   I don't want to totally get into that, but it is interesting though that the Vatican
  
  381
  00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:04,819
   has had a number of spokesmen and I believe the current Pope recently made a statement
  
  382
  00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:10,899
   and tell me if you know the statement alluding to the fact of some kind of extra terrestrial
  
  383
  00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:11,899
   alien visitation.
  
  384
  00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,500
   Tell our viewers about that.
  
  385
  00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,819
   Well, he's come right out.
  
  386
  00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:20,939
   The short response is that he said that should we be visited or discover or communicate
  
  387
  00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:28,419
   with quote aliens, which is a broad stroke term in itself, he would welcome the opportunity
  
  388
  00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:34,619
   and I'm paraphrasing to baptize another form of life, aliens.
  
  389
  00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,819
   Where is that in the Bible?
  
  390
  00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:38,659
   That's my challenge to him.
  
  391
  00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:45,219
   And there's been a number, I mean, they have a, as I understand it, some kind of Vatican
  
  392
  00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:49,179
   ambassador, that's not probably the right word, program for ETs.
  
  393
  00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:50,179
   Sure.
  
  394
  00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:57,659
   In the UN, we have a UN spokesperson for the visitation by aliens that that person, I
  
  395
  00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,459
   forget her name at the moment, but she is our world representative.
  
  396
  00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,899
   Take me to your leader, Sonario.
  
  397
  00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,380
   And then we have, and there's been prominent discussions among a whole series of presidents
  
  398
  00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:17,060
   in the last 20 years where this agenda, this Sonario's played a Ronald Reagan.
  
  399
  00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:24,259
   Ronald Reagan would be one in Clinton and Obama and a lot of them.
  
  400
  00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:28,420
   So those are hints, those are tantalizing.
  
  401
  00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,660
   Little the masses.
  
  402
  00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
   Okay.
  
  403
  00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
   Little hints.
  
  404
  00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:42,980
   But do you tie that into the CERN collider and tell us where you think this agenda is going?
  
  405
  00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,779
   Well, I think we've addressed it to the extent of opening the portal to communicate.
  
  406
  00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,019
   Let's talk about maybe someone else that everyone will recognize.
  
  407
  00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:56,820
   That's Dr. Stephen Hawking, one of the most renowned particle physicist in the world, a
  
  408
  00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,980
   mathematician.
  
  409
  00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,539
   He made the statement, I'll paraphrase, but he said, addressing the agenda, the purpose
  
  410
  00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:09,059
   of CERN, he said, you do not want to open this interdimensional gateway because you don't
  
  411
  00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,259
   know what's going to come through.
  
  412
  00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:15,539
   So would he have been, is, would you call him a critic of the, of the program?
  
  413
  00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:21,620
   I would in the sense of their goal of disturbing the fabric of space.
  
  414
  00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:30,699
   Because he said that if we are able to tear the veil to go to the Hadron, the God particle,
  
  415
  00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:31,699
   the Higgs boson.
  
  416
  00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:32,939
   Oh, yes, right.
  
  417
  00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:33,939
   Right.
  
  418
  00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:38,179
   They allegedly discovered this in the latter part of 2012 and into 2013.
  
  419
  00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:44,299
   He said that if you disturb the Higgs field, which is part of this Higgs boson scenario,
  
  420
  00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:50,500
   you could disturb that enough that you would create vacuums, a vacuum bubble that would
  
  421
  00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,140
   envelop at the speed of light, not only this planet, but in the entire universe.
  
  422
  00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:02,099
   Now this is coming from an eminent scientist, mainstream scientist, who's an atheist.
  
  423
  00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,099
   He's an atheist.
  
  424
  00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:04,099
   Right.
  
  425
  00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:07,740
   Now that hasn't happened, it hasn't played out yet since the discovery of the Higgs boson
  
  426
  00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,220
   and I apologize for the lapse.
  
  427
  00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,779
   But what he is addressing is this rift, this opening of this portal, this interdimensional
  
  428
  00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:22,339
   gateway, because he recognizes that there are entities on the other side that should not
  
  429
  00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:25,619
   be an R realm, that that barrier needs to be maintained.
  
  430
  00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:27,420
   Wait, wait.
  
  431
  00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,099
   Stephen Hawking recognizes that there are entities.
  
  432
  00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,099
   Yes.
  
  433
  00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,099
   Yes.
  
  434
  00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:35,500
   And has he, did he use the word entities or a similar word?
  
  435
  00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,299
   He uses unknown energies.
  
  436
  00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,299
   Unknown energies.
  
  437
  00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,299
   Right.
  
  438
  00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,099
   But he's referring to entities in our parlance.
  
  439
  00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:44,099
   Okay.
  
  440
  00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:53,980
   So, he's concerned about unwanted visitors, a home invasion of you, if you will, from
  
  441
  00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,139
   another dimension by entities.
  
  442
  00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:58,139
   That's correct.
  
  443
  00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:02,899
   He's not the only one that's raised that issue, not necessarily vacuum bubbles, but this
  
  444
  00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:05,019
   communication and this opening.
  
  445
  00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:12,659
   So there are enough atheists, oriented scientists out there who've been suppressed, but you
  
  446
  00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,540
   can find their statements on the internet.
  
  447
  00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,660
   This isn't conspiracy theorists origin.
  
  448
  00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,700
   These are mainstream people who are saying we really shouldn't do this.
  
  449
  00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,140
   In fact, the director said, the director of the Hays and Collider program.
  
  450
  00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,420
   Of the large Hays and Collider, as I said earlier, said, we don't really know what's going
  
  451
  00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,100
   to happen when we open this portal, but we're going to try anyway.
  
  452
  00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,259
   We're going to do it anyway.
  
  453
  00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,259
   I'm paraphrasing.
  
  454
  00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:47,779
   That's much like when the first atomic bomb was tested at Genny, and Oppenheimer's famous
  
  455
  00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,900
   statement, I've become God.
  
  456
  00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,259
   I've become death, not God, but I've become death.
  
  457
  00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:58,500
   Predating that were the concerns of the scientists at Los Alamos worried that they would ignite
  
  458
  00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,940
   the atmosphere when they detonated the first bomb.
  
  459
  00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,539
   So they weren't sure.
  
  460
  00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,579
   Now you can transplant that to the present time.
  
  461
  00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:08,619
   We have the same scenario.
  
  462
  00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:14,459
   And as you know, because we discussed it earlier, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, I guess the father
  
  463
  00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:22,059
   of the Manhattan Project, that decision was made at the Bohemian Grove, heavily occultic
  
  464
  00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:26,379
   society near San Francisco.
  
  465
  00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:36,899
   The same statue of the same Hindu God Shiva, the destroyer of worlds, was there during the
  
  466
  00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:37,899
   Manhattan Project.
  
  467
  00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,900
   Yes.
  
  468
  00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,019
   And he knew that they were going to crack open something.
  
  469
  00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:45,340
   He's a practicing Hindu.
  
  470
  00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
   He was a pro-Human Hindu.
  
  471
  00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
   Oh, he was.
  
  472
  00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
   Okay.
  
  473
  00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,220
   And now, here we fast forward to the Hadron Collider.
  
  474
  00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,780
   And as you said, and I've seen the picture, and if you're a doubter, you can see the picture.
  
  475
  00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,620
   It's everywhere.
  
  476
  00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,060
   That same Hindu God, you know, she's doing this weird dance.
  
  477
  00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,420
   I believe it's Shiva.
  
  478
  00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,820
   It is Shiva, the God of destroyer.
  
  479
  00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:14,259
   And then the leveling of the plane field, the wiping clean of the slate, and then the
  
  480
  00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,579
   rebirthing.
  
  481
  00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:19,980
   That's a three-step process that he, she, she's a duality, represents.
  
  482
  00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
   That's right.
  
  483
  00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,179
   And that speaks to the movement of transhumanism, we see today.
  
  484
  00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:29,899
   But also the geometry of the statue is replicated in the machine itself in the form of the geometric
  
  485
  00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:36,659
   configuration of the detectors that are analyzing the particles when they collide.
  
  486
  00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:37,659
   Wow.
  
  487
  00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,900
   The geometry is there, which speaks to sacred geometry and numerology that's employed
  
  488
  00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,580
   here as well.
  
  489
  00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,900
   Now, let me underscore it real quick.
  
  490
  00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,019
   Not my belief, their belief, and I assign it to the world of mythology.
  
  491
  00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:51,019
   Okay.
  
  492
  00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,180
   I don't find this in scripture.
  
  493
  00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
   Okay.
  
  494
  00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,259
   But we do see their practice of their worship of the Black Sun.
  
  495
  00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:57,259
   Yes.
  
  496
  00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:01,460
   You mentioned the Nazis sort of off-handered.
  
  497
  00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,460
   Yes.
  
  498
  00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
   Exactly.
  
  499
  00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:09,579
   So, when we look at the hidden agenda, we have to look at Saturn and the worship of Saturn,
  
  500
  00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:14,820
   again, the Vatican, but we can put it to the science now, and they believe that with the
  
  501
  00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:22,139
   large Hadron collider, they can reconnect electrically in a more profound fashion than exist
  
  502
  00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,900
   electrically now with Saturn.
  
  503
  00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,179
   All the planets, everything communicates electrically already in the electric model of the
  
  504
  00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,179
   universe.
  
  505
  00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,179
   They want to establish a profound plasma conduit, I call it.
  
  506
  00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,659
   Plasma conduit, okay.
  
  507
  00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,859
   Between Earth and Saturn, because they believe they can tap into both spiritual and physical
  
  508
  00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:45,619
   energy from that planet for their use here on this planet, and it all plays in Saturn.
  
  509
  00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:46,619
   Right.
  
  510
  00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,339
   This is not esoteric stuff.
  
  511
  00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:50,659
   This is the new normal.
  
  512
  00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,659
   Correct.
  
  513
  00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,259
   You know, it is.
  
  514
  00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,460
   Anybody goes to the movies.
  
  515
  00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,699
   The kids are saturated with all this.
  
  516
  00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:05,259
   Stanley Kubrick, as you know, was secretly trying to communicate this stuff about the Saturn
  
  517
  00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:10,059
   satanic cult in his films, especially 2001, a space Odyssey.
  
  518
  00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:11,059
   Absolutely.
  
  519
  00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:20,419
   That was a reference to the planet Saturn, and these black obelisks and alchemical magic.
  
  520
  00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,419
   He was involved in...
  
  521
  00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:30,940
   I don't know if you can say good freemasins, bad freemasins, but he was obviously involved
  
  522
  00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:38,300
   in some kind of a cultic belief system, but he was very much opposed to this Saturn death
  
  523
  00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:45,059
   cult, as he called it, and he tried to communicate it through symbols and language in his movies.
  
  524
  00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,539
   Yes, he did.
  
  525
  00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:53,220
   So I mean, this may sound like science fiction to you, but it's not science fiction.
  
  526
  00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:59,259
   Maybe it would have sounded like science fiction to have a cell phone and an automobile and
  
  527
  00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:03,699
   a jet 200 years ago, but the world changed.
  
  528
  00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:05,579
   It's now normal.
  
  529
  00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:12,699
   There's so many important things, and now people say, oh, this is new age and whatever.
  
  530
  00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:13,699
   That's nonsensical.
  
  531
  00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:16,980
   That's like saying your cell phone's new age.
  
  532
  00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
   You know what I'm saying?
  
  533
  00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,779
   You're talking about science and technology.
  
  534
  00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,620
   You're study of the Bible and you're understanding of theology.
  
  535
  00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:31,940
   You then draw in from a biblical worldview, an analysis from a biblical worldview of what's
  
  536
  00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:39,180
   going on based on the documented statements of these people, which matches up, for example,
  
  537
  00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,220
   with the Apostle Paul and Ephesians.
  
  538
  00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,220
   For our fight is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, powers and the
  
  539
  00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,220
   dark unseen forces of wickedness and heavenly places.
  
  540
  00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:56,179
   So this hierarchy of beings that Hawking alluded to and the other director of the Hadron
  
  541
  00:36:56,179 --> 00:37:00,419
   Collider, it's not non-biblical.
  
  542
  00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,219
   It's not new age.
  
  543
  00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:09,179
   It's simply an integration of technology and science, and that's not new age.
  
  544
  00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:11,179
   That's what's...
  
  545
  00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:17,939
   I don't think a lot of people get the fact that science has merged with the new age
  
  546
  00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,019
   movement and the occult.
  
  547
  00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:26,139
   I think that if people will accept the fact that you can go to the internet and you can
  
  548
  00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:31,460
   see the documentation of what I've already described, that's evidence that you could take
  
  549
  00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:37,380
   to someone who perhaps hasn't been saved and use that as leverage, as inducement, as
  
  550
  00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,980
   a way to get them to begin to think critically for themselves.
  
  551
  00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,380
   Something that a lot of us have lost because of environmental, because of culture, because
  
  552
  00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,780
   of education system, the indoctrination processes we've talked about have lost that critical
  
  553
  00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,860
   analytical process, that critical thinking skill.
  
  554
  00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,539
   It's a skill set.
  
  555
  00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:05,140
   But if you can take the evidence and encourage someone to use their rudimentary abilities
  
  556
  00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,700
   to think critically and examine the evidence and perhaps pursue that evidence, which is
  
  557
  00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:16,899
   the purpose of my books, then they can come to a realization themselves that the evidence
  
  558
  00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:22,980
   speaks for itself, not only the physics is going on, but the agenda that's driving the
  
  559
  00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,739
   physics, because I often say you cannot separate the physical from the spiritual.
  
  560
  00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:34,379
   So to say that science operates in a vacuum is full of hot air.
  
  561
  00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,379
   Yeah, right.
  
  562
  00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,379
   It's nonsense.
  
  563
  00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:37,379
   Right.
  
  564
  00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:38,379
   So science is definitely...
  
  565
  00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:39,379
   It's alchemy.
  
  566
  00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,379
   Yes.
  
  567
  00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
   It's sorcery.
  
  568
  00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,380
   It is sorcery.
  
  569
  00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,380
   Right.
  
  570
  00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,740
   And in a spiritual, but they're integrated together.
  
  571
  00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,539
   The goal is to take the evidence and save souls.
  
  572
  00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:51,140
   To take the evidence and save souls.
  
  573
  00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,140
   That you're talking about.
  
  574
  00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,140
   And save souls.
  
  575
  00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,460
   Exactly.
  
  576
  00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,500
   And I agree with you, because, you know, there are so many young people, the millennial
  
  577
  00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,539
   generation, younger adults of all age groups.
  
  578
  00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,180
   They're turned off by religion.
  
  579
  00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,539
   They're turned off by the religion of Christianity.
  
  580
  00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:13,739
   But when you start to use these scientific facts, which are loosely interpreted in all
  
  581
  00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:18,860
   the movies they're watching, the one with Johnny Depp when he uploads his consciousness
  
  582
  00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,460
   into a computer and we can go on and on and on.
  
  583
  00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,219
   You grasp tangible and relatable.
  
  584
  00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:30,779
   It has relevance to their frame of mind, the exact present way of thinking and their
  
  585
  00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:34,739
   culture, the generation, generation, generation.
  
  586
  00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,459
   It's relevant to them because you can give them something that's not only tangible, but
  
  587
  00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:43,539
   something that they understand because of the predictive programming they've been fed.
  
  588
  00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:44,539
   Right.
  
  589
  00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:45,539
   Right.
  
  590
  00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,339
   You flip that around 180 degrees, that programming and say, use that programming as evidence
  
  591
  00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,899
   to say, here's the truth.
  
  592
  00:39:52,899 --> 00:39:58,659
   Now let's get back to the, to the B system because obviously the B system is in the Bible
  
  593
  00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,779
   in numerous places.
  
  594
  00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,980
   In 2013, especially with the false prophet and the Antichrist and the Mark of the Beast,
  
  595
  00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:12,220
   which could be a microchip implant, nanochip, whatever.
  
  596
  00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,220
   You talk about, it's difficult for me to pronounce the name of the computer.
  
  597
  00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,380
   The A Diabatic.
  
  598
  00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,060
   The A Diabatic without heat process.
  
  599
  00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,140
   A Diabatic, quantum computer.
  
  600
  00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,140
   A QC is an easier way to talk about it.
  
  601
  00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140
   A QC.
  
  602
  00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:30,980
   Okay, now you relate this to the B system, I want to find out why.
  
  603
  00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,859
   But you, you tell us and I want our viewers to grasp this, that this, are they building
  
  604
  00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,739
   this computer now?
  
  605
  00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:41,779
   It's already been built in the model 2048.
  
  606
  00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:43,859
   They started with a 128 model.
  
  607
  00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,179
   Not the year.
  
  608
  00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:48,099
   But the model number two zero four eight.
  
  609
  00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,099
   Right.
  
  610
  00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:50,099
   It's already built.
  
  611
  00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,779
   Well, there've been multiple generations that have been built.
  
  612
  00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:57,099
   But the early stages, like the early, the first one was 2008.
  
  613
  00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:04,619
   Wow, the 2048 was released to the public in January of last year, 2015.
  
  614
  00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,420
   Now you describe it as equivalent to seven billion human brains.
  
  615
  00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,900
   They has this computer reach that level yet?
  
  616
  00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
   Yes.
  
  617
  00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,699
   So this computer, how big is it, by the way, physically?
  
  618
  00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:21,099
   Well, interestingly, it's housed in a black cube.
  
  619
  00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:28,460
   Can you say mecca, black sun, the worship of, and we go to 2001 with the obelisk, right?
  
  620
  00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,819
   It wasn't a cube, but it was a black rectangle.
  
  621
  00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:31,819
   Right.
  
  622
  00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:32,819
   How big of a black cube is it?
  
  623
  00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:36,179
   We're talking about something about the size of this stage here in the studio.
  
  624
  00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:41,420
   So this computer is about a black cube about the size of this television set.
  
  625
  00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,659
   And yet it has the intelligence and memory or whatever.
  
  626
  00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:48,500
   That's equivalent to seven billion human brains.
  
  627
  00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
   That's correct.
  
  628
  00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
   Now this is a housing.
  
  629
  00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:59,460
   It's a shield that separates it from all electromagnetic interference to maintain the stability
  
  630
  00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,940
   of the processor.
  
  631
  00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,699
   It's what's called coherence and decoherence in computer science.
  
  632
  00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:12,059
   But inside the cube is something that is arranged just like the spinal column of a human.
  
  633
  00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:17,179
   And it has what are known as qubits that are essentially constructed of gold but other
  
  634
  00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:18,179
   components.
  
  635
  00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:20,380
   But these are not transistor based.
  
  636
  00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:26,700
   These are a complete departure in the technology from transistors which are silicon gate model
  
  637
  00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,940
   processors.
  
  638
  00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,980
   This is a complete quantum leap into another way of processing information.
  
  639
  00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:42,380
   And it does so so quickly that it has no relevance, no comparison to the gate model transistor
  
  640
  00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,700
   based even transistor quantum computer.
  
  641
  00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:50,939
   So we're talking about something that most people who have not studied the a diabetic quantum
  
  642
  00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:54,579
   computer process can't wrap their heads around.
  
  643
  00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:58,139
   It's a very deep topic but I want to be succinct here.
  
  644
  00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:00,619
   It operates inter-dimensionally.
  
  645
  00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,460
   When I spoke of earlier that they're already communicating with the other side without
  
  646
  00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:11,139
   having opened a gateway, a portal, a physical portal in the dimension, they're communicating
  
  647
  00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:15,179
   using this computer because and this comes right from the manufacturers.
  
  648
  00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,539
   It's public disclosure information.
  
  649
  00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:20,539
   I didn't have to get this in a secret of a manner.
  
  650
  00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:23,699
   They do what are called combinatorial programming.
  
  651
  00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:29,019
   They take all possible solutions and at one time feed it into the machine through an interface
  
  652
  00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:32,980
   which happens to be a black cube itself, the interface device.
  
  653
  00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,219
   And by their own admission it enters into another dimension where the processing takes
  
  654
  00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:43,819
   place and then they extract from that other dimension the solution to the combinatorial
  
  655
  00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:45,139
   problem.
  
  656
  00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:51,819
   That is communication with an actual physical tool to another dimension.
  
  657
  00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:57,579
   Now when it's communicating to another dimension is it communicating to a consciousness or an
  
  658
  00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,460
   intelligence and another dimension?
  
  659
  00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,699
   Yes, it is.
  
  660
  00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:09,940
   Because it happens definitively, repeatedly, measurably, they're able to do this consistently.
  
  661
  00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,860
   There was a lot of doubt in the transistor based world of quantum computing that the company
  
  662
  00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:22,460
   that put this quantum or qubit based processor together that they really were achieving any
  
  663
  00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,059
   definitive answers and that were reliable and coherent that were stable.
  
  664
  00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:30,059
   But they have proven over and over again.
  
  665
  00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:34,780
   Let me give you one example of who's purchasing Google.
  
  666
  00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,220
   The first model was purchased by Lockheed and USC with an open public computer laboratory
  
  667
  00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:47,460
   that the public can access with their first model and it has advanced through 5, 12 model
  
  668
  00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,980
   for example, where two of which were purchased by Google a few years ago, they now have the
  
  669
  00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,980
   2048.
  
  670
  00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,780
   The 2048 represents the number of qubits.
  
  671
  00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,580
   That is connected to the large Hadron collider for the purpose of opening the portal and
  
  672
  00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,340
   maintaining the stability of it.
  
  673
  00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:09,460
   Okay, so when you say this computer is connected to the large Hadron collider, it somehow is
  
  674
  00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,780
   electronically or something connected to it.
  
  675
  00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,980
   It's no different than our computer networking setup.
  
  676
  00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,059
   So it's networked in to the large Hadron collider.
  
  677
  00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:19,059
   That's correct.
  
  678
  00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:26,380
   So we have literally, it reminds me of 2001 Space Odyssey.
  
  679
  00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,380
   There's the Ape.
  
  680
  00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,380
   How old are you?
  
  681
  00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,380
   9000.
  
  682
  00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,500
   Yeah, and then there's the Ape and the Obelisk and the PAL.
  
  683
  00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
   Sure.
  
  684
  00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,059
   I believe in the biblical worldview.
  
  685
  00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:46,059
   But it would seem to me that with this level of 7 billion human brains of intelligence,
  
  686
  00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:47,820
   and this is the beef system.
  
  687
  00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,460
   Yeah, the beef system.
  
  688
  00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,659
   It seems to me that it's already artificially intelligent.
  
  689
  00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:56,659
   Absolutely.
  
  690
  00:45:56,659 --> 00:46:00,260
   But it must be advanced, self-advancing itself.
  
  691
  00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:06,660
   So it's moving towards a singularity where its intelligence surpasses man.
  
  692
  00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,460
   Do you think it's already on the way to that?
  
  693
  00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,460
   It is.
  
  694
  00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460
   That is the goal.
  
  695
  00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,500
   The question offer narrizes, is it yet sentient?
  
  696
  00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
   Is it self-aware?
  
  697
  00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,860
   I don't believe it is.
  
  698
  00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,820
   And I base that only on the evidence that I look at, not conjecture or speculation.
  
  699
  00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,140
   So how does it sound?
  
  700
  00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:31,659
   So how tell us how, in a biblical sense, this connects with the beef system in the book
  
  701
  00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:32,659
   of Revelation?
  
  702
  00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:37,659
   Well, the beef system we hear of, if you don't accept the mark of the beef, then no man
  
  703
  00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:38,659
   can buy or sell.
  
  704
  00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,619
   All of that control mechanism.
  
  705
  00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,819
   How do you control over 7 billion people?
  
  706
  00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:43,819
   Right.
  
  707
  00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:46,059
   You have a computer that's equivalent to 7 billion people.
  
  708
  00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:47,699
   That's why I cite that.
  
  709
  00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:50,099
   Coming from the Manning Faxures own citation.
  
  710
  00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,099
   Okay?
  
  711
  00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,619
   So I'm just repeating their information.
  
  712
  00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:58,339
   But the point is, you have to have a sophisticated system to be able to control not just the movement
  
  713
  00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:04,179
   of people and the movement of goods and transactions and governments, but the minds of people.
  
  714
  00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:07,579
   You're creating a surf class of human beings.
  
  715
  00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:12,900
   When you accept the mark of the beef, you lose all awareness that you have even been modified.
  
  716
  00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,380
   You don't even know that you've been changed.
  
  717
  00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,460
   So your memories are raised like some of the sci-fi movies?
  
  718
  00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:23,980
   Well, in the sense of your own self-awareness, your own knowledge of your soul.
  
  719
  00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
   Okay.
  
  720
  00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:32,539
   So when you take the biblical mark of the beast, which is the technology, it's deeper than
  
  721
  00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:34,579
   it goes to the DNA.
  
  722
  00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:37,900
   It tells us how it goes to the DNA.
  
  723
  00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,019
   The sounds far fetched, but when you accept the mark of the beast, what you are actually
  
  724
  00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:47,579
   doing is accepting into your body, and there will be numerous routes to this.
  
  725
  00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:50,460
   This can be through inhalation of nanoparticles.
  
  726
  00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,139
   This can be the acceptance of a vaccine for you and your children and your loved ones.
  
  727
  00:47:55,139 --> 00:48:00,699
   Once it's introduced into the body by any route, it then is a modifier to the DNA.
  
  728
  00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:02,820
   I call it the third strand of DNA.
  
  729
  00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,940
   We have a double helix.
  
  730
  00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,980
   This is going to be a triple helix.
  
  731
  00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:11,460
   This is an artificial construct that can be digitally imparted with information and then
  
  732
  00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,220
   controlled from an external source.
  
  733
  00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:18,780
   That control mechanism, the linkage, comes through the electromagnetic connection.
  
  734
  00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,900
   We can call it microwaves or whatever, or ELF, extremely low frequency, be it whatever
  
  735
  00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:29,619
   frequency, but that is the link to humans from that computer.
  
  736
  00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:34,619
   And that is the beast system that controls us through our DNA, which has been modified,
  
  737
  00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,220
   and then it changes our thought processes.
  
  738
  00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,260
   It rewires our synapses in our own mind.
  
  739
  00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,100
   Those are our brains are constructed from our DNA.
  
  740
  00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,740
   You modify the core, you modify the brain.
  
  741
  00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,820
   I want to share this with you.
  
  742
  00:48:49,820 --> 00:49:00,500
   I'm so thankful that we had the opportunity to interview Anthony and his incredible research.
  
  743
  00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,460
   This may be overwhelming to you, but I want to just remind you of something, and I know
  
  744
  00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,420
   Anthony knows this, and I know many of you know this.
  
  745
  00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,340
   He had knew you before the foundation of the world.
  
  746
  00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,220
   He knew you outside of space and time.
  
  747
  00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,099
   He knew you before he created the world.
  
  748
  00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:24,220
   He pre-planned for you to be here at this exact time period in human history.
  
  749
  00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:30,619
   Now since God pre-planned for you to be here in this time period of human history, where
  
  750
  00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:37,700
   all this stuff is happening, that Anthony is explaining in others from a biblical perspective.
  
  751
  00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:44,219
   You don't have to have fear because God pre-planned for you to be here in this time zone when
  
  752
  00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,699
   all this stuff was going on.
  
  753
  00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:55,539
   And that obviously implies that God already downloaded in you before the beginning of time,
  
  754
  00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:58,219
   and I'm using this in a metaphorical sense.
  
  755
  00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:05,739
   The apps or applications or the spiritual gifts or the natural gifts that you need to be
  
  756
  00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:11,779
   victorious in dealing with all this stuff that we've been talking about.
  
  757
  00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:14,699
   Because God pre-planned for you to be here.
  
  758
  00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:17,859
   So this should not cause a panic attack.
  
  759
  00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:26,259
   This should cause a release of supernatural joy and expectation because you are downloaded
  
  760
  00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:32,819
   with something far more powerful than this 7 billion human mind computer.
  
  761
  00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,140
   You've been given the mind of Christ.
  
  762
  00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:41,820
   The mind of Christ is vastly superior to everything we've been talking about.
  
  763
  00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,420
   And you have the Holy Spirit living inside you.
  
  764
  00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,539
   Greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world.
  
  765
  00:50:48,539 --> 00:51:00,500
   So fear should not even be an option.
  
  766
  00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,980
   I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, set the Lord, which is and which was and
  
  767
  00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,019
   which is the Comcom, the Almighty.
  
  768
  00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:14,820
   He which testifies these things says, surely I come quickly.
  
  769
  00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,820
   Amen.
  
  770
  00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:45,780
   Even so, Comcom, Lord Jesus.
